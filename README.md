# Evolutionary Neural Network Game Controller

This project implements a Java program that evolves feed-forward neural networks to control two classic arcade games: Breakout and Pacman. The goal is to optimize the performance of the neural networks using a genetic algorithm.

## Features

- Utilizes feed-forward neural networks for game control.
- Implements a genetic algorithm to optimize network weights.
- Provides APIs for interacting with Breakout and Pacman games.
- Generates populations of neural networks and evaluates their performance using fitness functions.
- Applies evolutionary process to improve network performance over multiple generations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Eclipse IDE or any other Java IDE for development.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
